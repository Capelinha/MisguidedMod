# MisguidedMod

Extends server render distance by storing local cache!

Now, you can explore vast stretches of terrain without sacrificing visual quality, as the mod downloads and stores chunks in a local cache. This means less waiting time and more adventure time, allowing you to make the most out of your server even when the render distance is reduced.

Don't let render distance limitations hinder your Minecraft fun. Install this mod and enjoy a more expansive and immersive gaming environment than ever before. Your adventures will never be the same again!

Using this mod on the Wynncraft server could be a great idea as the render distance is very reduced there.
